## 2025 Uttarkashi Flash Flood (Dharali / Kheer Ganga)

On **5 August 2025**, a catastrophic multi-hazard flash flood struck the Dharali region along the Kheer Ganga river system in Uttarkashi district. Preliminary IMD and field analyses suggest an intense cloudburst, with rainfall rates exceeding ~200 mm/hr over a highly concentrated zone.

### Causes
The cascading nature of the disaster combined:
- Extreme precipitation  
- Possible glacial lake outburst flooding (GLOF)  
- Potential glacier collapse mechanisms  
- Secondary landslide activity  

All converged to produce devastating floods that swept through the narrow valleys.

### Impacts
- **Casualties**: At least 5 confirmed deaths, with 50–100 people reported missing or stranded during rescue operations.  
- **Infrastructure & Property Damage**:  
  - 40–50 houses and 50 hotels destroyed  
  - Dharali market submerged; Army camp and helipad damaged  
  - Severe losses to transport, communication, and essential services  
- **Secondary Hazard**: Formation of a temporary 400–500 m-long upstream lake, raising fears of additional downstream flooding  

### Response
Rescue operations involved the Indian Army (*Ibex Brigade*), NDRF, SDRF, and aerial units. Despite difficult terrain and disrupted infrastructure, more than 190 people were rescued in the initial phase.

### Significance
The Uttarkashi flash flood highlights the compounding role of climate change in amplifying atmospheric moisture, destabilizing Himalayan cryosphere systems, and creating cascading multi-hazard scenarios that overwhelm both natural landscapes and human settlements.

## 2021 Uttarakhand Flood (Chamoli / Rishiganga-Dhauliganga Avalanche / Glacial Break)

### Date & Location
- **Event date**: 7 February 2021  
- **District**: Chamoli, Uttarakhand (outer Garhwal Himalayas), affecting the **Rishiganga, Dhauliganga, and Alaknanda river valleys**  

### Trigger(s)
- A **large rock + ice avalanche** from **Ronti Peak** (or part of the Nanda Devi glacier) dislodged, sending debris, ice, and water into river valleys.  
- Initial reports speculated a **glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF)**, but later studies found **no conclusive evidence**; more consistent with **avalanche + ice-rock collapse**.  
- **Unusually warm weather** was considered a contributing factor, weakening ice/rock stability.  

### Casualties & Missing
- **Confirmed fatalities**: ~83 people  
- **Missing / presumed missing**: ~121 people  
- Many victims were **workers at hydropower and tunnel construction sites** (Tapovan-Vishnugad, etc.).  

### Damage & Impacts
- Severe destruction of **hydropower infrastructure**: Rishiganga project, Tapovan-Vishnugad plant.  
- **Houses damaged**; some areas buried under **~21 feet of slush**.  
- **Large-scale evacuations** downstream; **controlled dam releases** to reduce risks to Haridwar and Rishikesh.  

### Response / Relief
- **NDRF, Indian Army, and Air Force** deployed for rescue operations.  
- Emergency evacuations; operations to free **workers trapped in tunnels**.  

### Significance & Lessons
- Demonstrated how **cryosphere instability** (ice-rock-glacier collapse) can unleash catastrophic floods with **minimal warning**.  
- Exposed vulnerabilities of **high-altitude infrastructure** built in hazard-prone zones.  
- Raised questions on **climate warming** and its role in increasing frequency of such disasters.  
- Emphasized the need for **glacier monitoring, hazard mapping, and early warning systems** in the Himalayas.

## 2013 Kedarnath Catastrophe

Between **15–17 June 2013**, the Kedarnath region of Rudraprayag district experienced the deadliest Himalayan disaster in modern history, striking at the height of the pilgrimage season.

### Meteorology & Triggers
- Field measurements from the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology (WIHG) recorded ~315 mm rainfall within 24 hours at Chorabari, with multi-day totals of ~300–385 mm.  
- Earlier simplified accounts citing 340 mm in six hours are now considered unsupported by gauge records.  
- The disaster was triggered by a triple interaction:  
  - Intense extreme rainfall  
  - Breach of the moraine-dammed Chorabari Lake  
  - Saturated mountain slopes leading to massive landslides  

### Impacts
- **Casualties**:  
  - Official death toll: ~5,700 presumed dead  
  - Government compilations (later): ~6,054 deaths including the missing  
  - Independent estimates: >10,000 fatalities (including unregistered pilgrims)  
- **Economic Losses**:  
  - Estimated at ₹12,000+ crore (World Bank, PHDCCI)  
  - Long-term destruction of the tourism-dependent economy  
- **Infrastructure & Environment**:  
  - Massive damage to pilgrimage routes, roads, bridges, and hydropower projects  
  - Entire settlements swept away near Kedarnath  
- **Secondary Hazards**:  
  - Widespread landslides blocked escape routes  
  - Formation of temporary dammed lakes, later breaching and releasing destructive surges downstream  

### Significance
The Kedarnath tragedy remains the benchmark Himalayan disaster — a defining example of how a single meteorological trigger can unleash cascading hazards: rainfall, GLOF, moraine breach, and landslides — magnified by fragile mountain systems and human exposure.

## 2013 (or 2012) Ukhimath Cloudburst (Uncertain Record)

In **mid-September**, a severe cloudburst event struck the Ukhimath area of Rudraprayag district, demonstrating the region’s persistent vulnerability to extreme rainfall during the late monsoon period.

### Meteorology
- ~180 mm rainfall within ~3 hours, driven by **orographic convergence** (uplift of moist monsoon air by steep topography).  
- Localized, high-intensity rainfall overwhelmed drainage channels and destabilized mountain slopes.  

### Casualties
- Reports vary, citing **19 to 39 fatalities** across different government and media sources.  

### Chronology Confusion
- Some records cite **14 September 2012**, while others record **14 September 2013**.  
- Later reviews sometimes conflate the two years, leaving the precise timing uncertain.  

### Significance
The Ukhimath cloudburst illustrates both the localized nature of Himalayan cloudbursts and the challenges of reliable disaster record-keeping in remote regions.  

**Safest phrasing**: *“Ukhimath cloudburst (mid-September, 2012/2013, ~20–40 deaths)”*.
