## Plains Transition Zone Characteristics

Udham Singh Nagar district is situated in the lush Terai region of Uttarakhand and was established in October 1995, carved from the former Nainital district. The district encompasses a geographical area of 2,542 square kilometers and occupies the transition zone between the Himalayan foothills and the Indo-Gangetic plains, creating unique hydrological and meteorological conditions that differ from both the high mountain districts and the true plains areas. <br> <br>
The district lies between 28째N to 58째N latitude and 78째E to 81째E longitude, characterized as foot-of-hill Tarai terrain with rivers and dams. The relatively flat topography means that direct cloudburst risk is low, but the district remains vulnerable to flooding from extreme precipitation events occurring in upstream watersheds. As of 2011, it is the third most populous district of Uttarakhand after Haridwar and Dehradun, with a population of 1,648,902 according to the latest census, including 858,783 males and 790,119 females, giving it a sex ratio of 920 females per 1000 males.
