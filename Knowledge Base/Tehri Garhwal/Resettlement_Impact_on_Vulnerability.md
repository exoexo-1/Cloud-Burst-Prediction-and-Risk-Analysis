## Resettlement Impact on Vulnerability

The resettlement of 125,000 displaced people has created new patterns of vulnerability that may increase the overall risk profile of the district. New settlement patterns often involve construction on steeper and less stable slopes than the original valley floor locations that were inundated by the reservoir. These locations may be more susceptible to landslide hazards and may be more difficult to evacuate during emergency situations.
Infrastructure vulnerability has increased in some areas where new access roads have been constructed on unstable terrain to serve resettled communities. These roads may be more susceptible to closure during extreme weather events, potentially isolating communities and hampering emergency response efforts. The concentration of resettled populations in new locations has also created new pressure points where large numbers of people may be at risk from localized hazards.
