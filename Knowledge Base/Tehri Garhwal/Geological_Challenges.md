## Geological Challenges

The creation of the Tehri reservoir has introduced new geological hazards and modified existing hazard patterns in ways that continue to evolve as the system reaches equilibrium with its new hydrological conditions. Dam-induced seismicity has been documented through a network of seismometers that have recorded 847 micro-earthquakes between 2006 and 2023. While most of these events have been small, with magnitudes typically less than 3.0, one event reached magnitude 4.5, demonstrating that reservoir-triggered seismic activity can reach levels that pose potential risks to infrastructure and communities. The mechanism of reservoir-induced seismicity involves changes in stress conditions caused by the weight of the impounded water and changes in pore water pressure within rock formations surrounding the reservoir. These stress changes can reactivate existing faults or create new fractures, leading to seismic activity that would not have occurred under natural conditions. <br> <br>
Slope stability issues around the reservoir rim have become increasingly apparent as the reservoir has filled and water levels have fluctuated seasonally. Sixty-seven active landslide zones have been identified around the reservoir perimeter, where changes in groundwater flow patterns and bank saturation during high water periods have reduced slope stability. Changed groundwater flow patterns have affected wide areas around the reservoir, altering the hydrological conditions that control slope stability and potentially increasing landslide susceptibility in areas that were previously stable.Bank erosion and instability represent ongoing challenges that require continuous monitoring and management. The fluctuation of water levels associated with power generation and flood control operations creates cycles of bank saturation and exposure that can accelerate erosion processes and contribute to slope instability.
