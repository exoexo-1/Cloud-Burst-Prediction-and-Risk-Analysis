## Microclimate Modification

The presence of the large reservoir has created significant modifications to local microclimate conditions that influence the formation and behavior of extreme precipitation events. Lake effect phenomena similar to those observed around large natural lakes now occur around the Tehri reservoir, with enhanced local humidity levels increased by 15 to 20% compared to pre-dam conditions. Temperature moderation effects result in less extreme temperatures, with peak temperatures reduced by 2 to 3Â°C during summer months and minimum temperatures increased during winter months.
Modified wind patterns include the development of lake breeze circulation systems that create local convergence zones where atmospheric moisture can be concentrated and lifted. Enhanced fog formation occurs due to the increased moisture availability and temperature contrasts between the water surface and surrounding terrain, creating localized areas of reduced visibility and altered precipitation processes.
Precipitation changes resulting from the lake effect include orographic enhancement due to increased atmospheric moisture content, modified rainfall patterns on windward and leeward sides of the reservoir, and increased convective activity during summer months when thermal contrasts between the water surface and surrounding terrain are maximized. These changes have created new patterns of precipitation distribution that may not be fully captured by existing precipitation monitoring networks or reflected in historical climate records.
