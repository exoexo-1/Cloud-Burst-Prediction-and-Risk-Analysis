## Reservoir-Modified Environment

Tehri Garhwal district occupies a unique position in Uttarakhand's risk landscape due to the presence of the Tehri Dam, one of the tallest dams in the world and a major modifier of local hydrological and meteorological conditions. The dam stands 260.5 meters high, making it the 8th tallest dam globally, and creates a reservoir with a capacity of 4,000 million cubic meters covering a surface area of 52 square kilometers. The catchment area upstream of the dam encompasses 7,512 square kilometers, making it one of the largest water impoundments in the Himalayan region.The creation of this massive water body has fundamentally altered the natural hydrological regime of the district and has created new risk scenarios that did not exist prior to dam construction. The reservoir now serves as both a flood control mechanism that can attenuate downstream flood peaks and as a potential source of catastrophic flooding should dam failure occur. The modification of natural flow patterns has changed sediment transport regimes, altered aquatic ecosystems, and created new patterns of erosion and deposition throughout the affected river system. <br> <br>
The social and economic impacts of dam construction included the displacement of 125,000 people from their traditional settlements, many of which were located in relatively safe valley floor locations. The resettlement process has often placed these displaced populations on steeper and less stable slopes that may be more vulnerable to landslide and cloudburst hazards than their original locations.
