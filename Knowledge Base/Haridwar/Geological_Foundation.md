## Geological Foundation

The geological foundation of Haridwar district consists primarily of Quaternary alluvium and Siwalik deposits that have accumulated over millions of years. The Quaternary alluvium represents recent geological deposits that form the foundation for most of the district's agricultural and urban areas.

Soil types reflect this geological foundation, with new alluvium comprising approximately 70% of the district's soils. These soils are generally fertile and well-suited for agriculture but can become waterlogged during extreme precipitation events. Old alluvium accounts for about 20% of the soils and tends to be better drained but less fertile than newer deposits. Residual soils comprise the remaining 10% and occur primarily in areas where underlying bedrock is close to the surface.

The fertility of alluvial soils is generally high due to their nutrient-rich composition, particularly in nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium content. Drainage characteristics range from well-drained to moderately drained, depending on topographic position and soil texture, with better drainage typically found in areas with coarser soil textures and higher topographic positions.
