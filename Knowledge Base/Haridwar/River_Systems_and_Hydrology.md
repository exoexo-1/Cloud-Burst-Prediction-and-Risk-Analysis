## River Systems & Hydrology

The hydrological systems of Haridwar district are dominated by the Ganges River, which flows for 42 kilometers through the district as it transitions from the mountainous regions to the plains. This transition zone is characterized by changes in river gradient, flow velocity, and sediment transport capacity that can influence flood behavior during extreme events.

Tributary systems include the Kho, Piran, and Dhamola rivers, which drain the local watersheds and contribute to the overall hydrological complexity of the region. While these tributaries are smaller than the Ganges, they can experience significant flow increases during extreme precipitation events and contribute to local flooding problems.

Canal systems, including the Upper Ganges Canal and the Roorkee canal system, represent significant human modifications to the natural hydrology. These canals serve important irrigation and water supply functions but also create additional complexity in flood management and can potentially exacerbate flooding if not properly managed during extreme events.

Flood plains cover approximately 680 square kilometers of the district, representing areas that are naturally susceptible to flooding and should be considered in land use planning and risk management efforts. Historical floods in 1924, 1978, 1995, 2010, and 2013 demonstrate the recurring nature of flood risk in the district and provide important lessons about vulnerability and impacts.
