## Risk Factors

Cloudburst risk in Haridwar district is classified as low to moderate due to the limited topographic relief and lower elevation of most areas. However, the district faces significant risks from flash flooding caused by extreme precipitation events occurring in upstream watersheds, as well as from local drainage problems during intense precipitation.

Primary concerns include flash flooding in urban areas where natural drainage has been modified or constrained, and urban drainage system capacity limitations during extreme events. Vulnerable areas include the Siwalik foothills, particularly in the Rajaji National Park region, where some orographic enhancement can occur, and low-lying areas near rivers and canals that are naturally susceptible to flooding.
