## Comprehensive Geographical Profile


Haridwar district occupies a unique position in Uttarakhand's geography, serving as the gateway between the mountainous regions and the Indo-Gangetic plains. Located at coordinates 29.9457°N, 78.1642°E, the district covers 2,360 square kilometers of predominantly flat terrain interspersed with Siwalik hills that provide the only significant topographic relief.

The elevation range across the district is relatively modest compared to other areas of Uttarakhand, spanning from 249 meters above sea level at the point where the Ganges exits the mountains to 1,220 meters at the Chandi Devi hills. This limited elevation range means that the district experiences less orographic enhancement of precipitation compared to higher elevation areas, but it remains vulnerable to flash flooding when extreme precipitation events occur in upstream watersheds.

The terrain classification shows that approximately 85% of the district consists of plains areas, with the remaining 15% comprising Siwalik hills. This topographic configuration places most of the population and infrastructure in areas with relatively low direct cloudburst risk but high vulnerability to downstream flooding effects from events occurring in upstream areas.

Major landmarks within the district include Har Ki Pauri, one of the most sacred ghats on the Ganges River, and the Chandi Devi temple, located in the hills above Haridwar city. These landmarks attract millions of pilgrims and tourists annually, creating seasonal concentrations of population that could be vulnerable during extreme weather events.
