## Meteorological Characteristics

The meteorological characteristics of Haridwar district reflect its position at the transition between the submontane and plains climate zones. The district receives an annual precipitation total of 1,448 millimeters, which is lower than the higher elevation districts but still substantial enough to create flood risks during concentrated precipitation events.

Monsoon dependency is pronounced, with 82% of annual rainfall occurring during the June through September period. This concentration of precipitation creates the potential for extreme events even though the total annual rainfall is moderate. The remaining 18% of precipitation is distributed among pre-monsoon, post-monsoon, and winter periods, with western disturbances contributing to winter precipitation totals.

Temperature profiles show the influence of both continental and subtropical climate characteristics. Summer maximum temperatures typically reach 44째C, with a record high of 47.2째C demonstrating the intense heating that can occur in this region. This heating contributes to convective instability and can enhance the intensity of precipitation events when atmospheric moisture is available. Winter minimum temperatures typically drop to 2.1째C, with a record low of -1.2째C showing that the district can experience significant cooling during winter months.

Humidity variations across the year range from 25% during the driest periods to 90% during peak monsoon conditions, with this seasonal variation reflecting the alternation between dry continental air masses and moist maritime air masses. Wind systems are dominated by plains circulation patterns, with occasional orographic influences from the nearby Siwalik hills creating local modifications to wind flow patterns.
