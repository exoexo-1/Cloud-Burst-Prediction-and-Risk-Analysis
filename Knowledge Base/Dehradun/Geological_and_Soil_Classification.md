## Geological and Soil Classification

The geological foundation of Dehradun district comprises several distinct formations that influence both its topography and its vulnerability to extreme weather events. The Siwalik Group forms the dominant geological unit, consisting primarily of sandstone and conglomerate formations dating from the Miocene to Pliocene epochs. These sedimentary rocks are generally well-consolidated but can be susceptible to weathering and erosion under extreme precipitation conditions.

The Doon Gravel formation represents Quaternary alluvium that has been deposited in the valley floor over geological time scales. This formation provides generally stable foundation conditions but can experience rapid saturation and potential instability during extreme precipitation events. The Lesser Himalayan rocks, including phyllite and quartzite formations, occur in the elevated areas of the district and represent some of the older and more stable geological units in the region.

Soil classification across the district reflects the interaction between geological parent materials, climate, and topography. Alluvial soils dominate the valley floor areas, comprising approximately 60% of the district's soils. These soils are generally fertile and well-suited for agriculture but can become saturated quickly during extreme precipitation events. Brown forest soils cover approximately 25% of the district, primarily on hill slopes where they have developed under forest vegetation. Skeletal soils account for the remaining 15% and occur primarily on steep slopes where soil development is limited by erosion and mass wasting processes.

Soil characteristics vary significantly across the district but generally show pH values ranging from 6.5 to 7.5, indicating slightly acidic to neutral conditions favorable for most vegetation types. Organic matter content ranges from 1.5 to 3.2%, with higher values typically found in forest soils and lower values in heavily cultivated areas. Infiltration rates vary from 15 to 35 millimeters per hour, depending on soil type and compaction levels, while permeability is generally moderate to high, allowing reasonable drainage under normal conditions but potentially leading to rapid saturation during extreme events.
