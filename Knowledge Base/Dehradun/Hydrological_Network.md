##  Hydrological Network

The hydrological network of Dehradun district is dominated by the Yamuna river system, with the main stem flowing for 57 kilometers through the district. The Yamuna and its tributaries create a dendritic drainage pattern that efficiently collects precipitation from the surrounding watersheds but can also concentrate flood flows during extreme precipitation events.

The Tons river represents the major perennial tributary, fed by glacial melt from higher elevations and providing year-round flow. The Asan river is primarily seasonal and rain-fed, showing dramatic flow variations between monsoon and dry periods. The Suswa river is intermittent, flowing primarily during and immediately after significant precipitation events.

The drainage density across the district averages 0.85 kilometers per square kilometer, indicating a moderately well-developed drainage network. The basin characteristics show dendritic to sub-dendritic patterns typical of regions with relatively uniform geological conditions and moderate to high precipitation levels.

Flood history for the district includes major events in 1978, 1995, 2010, and 2013, demonstrating a recurring pattern of extreme hydrological events. These historical floods provide important lessons about the district's vulnerability and the types of conditions that can lead to catastrophic flooding.
