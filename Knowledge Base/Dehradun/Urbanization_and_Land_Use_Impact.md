## Urbanization and Land Use Impact

Urbanization has significantly altered the natural landscape and hydrology of Dehradun district, with urban areas now covering 285 square kilometers or approximately 9.2% of the total district area. This urban expansion has concentrated population and infrastructure in areas that may be vulnerable to extreme weather events and has altered natural drainage patterns through the construction of impervious surfaces.

Forest cover still accounts for 1,016 square kilometers or 32.9% of the district, providing important ecosystem services including watershed protection, carbon sequestration, and biodiversity conservation. However, forest cover has declined in recent decades due to urban expansion and agricultural conversion. Agricultural land covers 1,147 square kilometers or 37.1% of the district and represents an important economic base for the region.

The urban heat island effect has become increasingly pronounced in Dehradun city, with temperature differences of 3 to 5Â°C observed between urban areas and surrounding rural areas. This heat island effect can enhance convective activity and contribute to the formation of extreme precipitation events. Concrete coverage in the urban core reaches approximately 45%, significantly reducing infiltration capacity and increasing surface runoff during precipitation events.

Vulnerability factors related to urbanization include increased flash flood risk in urban areas due to reduced infiltration and modified drainage patterns, as well as the concentration of population and critical infrastructure in potentially vulnerable areas.
