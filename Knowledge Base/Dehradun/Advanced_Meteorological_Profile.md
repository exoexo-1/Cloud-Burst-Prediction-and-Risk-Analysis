## Advanced Meteorological Profile

Dehradun's meteorological characteristics reflect its position at the transition between the subtropical plains climate and the temperate mountain climate. The district receives an average annual rainfall of 2,073 millimeters based on thirty-year climatological data, making it one of the wetter districts in Uttarakhand and contributing significantly to its cloudburst susceptibility.

The seasonal distribution of rainfall shows the overwhelming dominance of the monsoon period, with June through September accounting for 1,650 millimeters or approximately 80% of the annual precipitation. This concentration of rainfall during the monsoon months creates conditions highly favorable for extreme precipitation events. Pre-monsoon rainfall from March to May contributes 180 millimeters or 9% of the annual total, often associated with convective activity and western disturbance effects. Post-monsoon precipitation from October to December adds 143 millimeters or 7%, while winter months from January to February contribute the remaining 100 millimeters or 4%.

Temperature extremes in the district reflect both its elevation range and seasonal variations. The maximum recorded temperature reached 43.5°C in May 2022, demonstrating the intense heating that can occur in the valley areas during pre-monsoon periods. This extreme heating contributes to convective instability and enhances the potential for cloudburst formation. Conversely, the minimum recorded temperature of -0.8°C in January 2019 shows the district's capacity for significant cooling, particularly in elevated areas.

Humidity patterns show dramatic seasonal variations, ranging from 85-95% during the monsoon period when atmospheric moisture content is maximized, to 40-60% during winter months when dry continental air masses dominate. The high monsoon humidity levels provide the moisture necessary for extreme precipitation events and contribute significantly to cloudburst formation potential.

Wind patterns across the district are influenced by both large-scale circulation patterns and local topographic effects. Valley winds typically range from 5 to 15 kilometers per hour and follow diurnal patterns influenced by differential heating between valley floors and surrounding hills. During the monsoon period, southwestern winds predominate with speeds ranging from 20 to 35 kilometers per hour, carrying moisture-laden air from the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea. Local circulation patterns include the characteristic diurnal mountain-valley wind system that can enhance convergence and contribute to cloudburst formation.
