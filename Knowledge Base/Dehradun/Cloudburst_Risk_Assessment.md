## Cloudburst Risk Assessment

Based on historical data and current understanding of atmospheric and topographic factors, Dehradun district has experienced 12 documented cloudburst events between 1970 and 2025, placing it in the moderate risk category compared to other districts in Uttarakhand. The peak risk zones within the district include the Mussoorie hills and the Chakrata region, where elevation and topographic complexity create optimal conditions for cloudburst formation.

The seasonality of cloudburst events in Dehradun follows the regional pattern, with 75% of events occurring during July and August when atmospheric moisture content and convective instability are maximized. This seasonal concentration allows for focused preparedness efforts during the peak risk period.

Prediction indicators specific to Dehradun district include orographic lifting effects on the southern slopes of hills, where moisture-laden air is forced upward by the topography. The urban heat island effect can create convergence zones that enhance convective activity, while valley channeling effects can focus atmospheric moisture into areas of enhanced precipitation. These local effects combine with broader atmospheric conditions to create the potential for extreme precipitation events.
