## Detailed Topographical Profile

Dehradun district occupies a strategically important position in Uttarakhand's geographical landscape, encompassing 3,088 square kilometers of diverse terrain that ranges from the broad Doon Valley floor to the hill stations of Mussoorie. The district is centered at coordinates 30.0668°N, 78.0718°E, positioning it at the interface between the Himalayan foothills and the Indo-Gangetic plains.

The elevation gradient across the district is remarkable, spanning from just 300 meters above sea level in the valley floor areas to 3,048 meters at the highest peaks around Mussoorie. This dramatic elevation change over relatively short distances creates complex microclimates and varying degrees of cloudburst susceptibility across different areas of the district.

The famous Doon Valley forms the heart of the district, representing a classic intermontane valley that extends approximately 77 kilometers in length and 25 kilometers in width. This broad valley configuration provides some protection from the most extreme orographic effects, though it still experiences significant weather amplification due to its position between major mountain ranges.

Major peaks within the district include Lal Tibba at 2,275 meters and Gun Hill at 2,024 meters, both located in the Mussoorie hill region. These elevated areas experience markedly different weather patterns compared to the valley floor, with enhanced precipitation, cooler temperatures, and increased susceptibility to cloudburst formation.

Slope analysis across the district reveals a varied topographic profile that influences both settlement patterns and hazard susceptibility. Valley areas with slopes between 0 and 15 degrees comprise 45% of the district and contain the majority of the population and infrastructure. Foothills with slopes between 15 and 30 degrees account for 35% of the area and represent transitional zones of moderate risk. Steeper hill areas with slopes between 30 and 45 degrees cover 15% of the district and face elevated risks from both cloudbursts and landslides. The steepest terrain, with slopes exceeding 45 degrees, comprises only 5% of the district but represents the highest risk areas for catastrophic slope failure during extreme precipitation events.
