## Hydrological Complexity

The hydrological systems of Uttarkashi district are characterized by extreme complexity and high variability that create challenging conditions for both prediction and impact mitigation. The Bhagirathi River system dominates the district's hydrology, draining a catchment area of 7,860 square kilometers within the district boundaries. Under normal conditions, the Bhagirathi maintains an average discharge of approximately 200 cubic meters per second, but this can increase to 15,000 cubic meters per second or more during extreme flood events.

The tributary network within the district adds layers of complexity to the hydrological system. The Jadh Ganga, being glacier-fed, exhibits a flashy hydrological regime with rapid responses to both meteorological events and glacial melt processes. The Assi Ganga represents a mixed rain-glacier fed system that shows characteristics of both precipitation-driven and melt-driven flow regimes. The Bhilangana River, as a major tributary, contributes significantly to flood potential and exhibits high gradient characteristics that can rapidly concentrate floodwaters.

The presence of 86 glacial lakes within the district creates the potential for glacial lake outburst flooding (GLOF) events that can occur independently or in combination with cloudburst events. These lakes represent stored water volumes that, if released suddenly through dam failure or overtopping, can create flood waves that travel rapidly down valley systems and can cause devastating impacts far from the original precipitation source.
