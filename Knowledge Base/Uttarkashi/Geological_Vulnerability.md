## Geological Vulnerability

The geological foundation of Uttarkashi district contributes significantly to both cloudburst formation potential and the severity of impacts when events occur. The dominant rock types throughout the district include formations from the Garhwal Group, consisting primarily of quartzite, phyllite, and schist that have undergone varying degrees of metamorphism and weathering. These rock types, while generally competent when fresh, can become highly susceptible to weathering and erosion when exposed to the extreme freeze-thaw cycles and chemical weathering processes common at high elevations.

The presence of Gangotri Granite throughout much of the district creates additional complexity in the geological hazard profile. This granite, while generally strong and resistant to weathering, is highly jointed and can become unstable when the joints are opened by weathering processes or when water pressure builds up within the joint systems during extreme precipitation events.

Moraine deposits throughout the district represent particularly hazardous geological units that are inherently unstable and highly permeable. These deposits, left behind by retreating glaciers, consist of loose rock debris that can quickly become saturated during precipitation events and are highly susceptible to landslide and debris flow formation.

Structural geological features add another dimension to the hazard profile, with the Main Central Thrust zone passing near the district and numerous subsidiary fault systems creating planes of weakness throughout the rock mass. High tectonic activity in the region means that earthquake-induced landslides represent an additional hazard that can be triggered by the same monsoon conditions that produce cloudbursts.

Landslide susceptibility throughout Uttarkashi district is classified as very high, with 847 active landslide zones identified and mapped. Approximately 23% of the total district area is classified as being under high landslide risk, meaning that cloudburst events have the potential to trigger cascading landslide hazards that can multiply the impacts of the original precipitation event.
