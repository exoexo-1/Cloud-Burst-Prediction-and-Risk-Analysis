## Comprehensive Risk Profile


Uttarkashi district represents the epicenter of cloudburst risk in Uttarakhand, combining extreme topographic complexity with optimal meteorological conditions to create what can only be described as perfect storm conditions for catastrophic precipitation events. Located at coordinates 30.7268°N, 78.4354°E, this vast district covers 8,016 square kilometers, making it the largest district in the state and encompassing some of the most challenging terrain in the entire Himalayan region.

The elevation spectrum across Uttarkashi is truly extraordinary, ranging from 1,000 meters above sea level in the deepest valley floors to the towering summit of Bandarpunch at 7,817 meters elevation. This massive vertical relief creates dramatic atmospheric conditions that are ideal for cloudburst formation. Research has identified the elevation band between 1,500 and 2,500 meters as the zone of maximum cloudburst susceptibility, and remarkably, this band encompasses vast areas of Uttarkashi district and includes numerous villages and critical infrastructure installations.

Statistical analysis of cloudburst events across Uttarakhand reveals that 66% of all documented cloudbursts have occurred within this optimal elevation band, and Uttarkashi district contains more area within this critical zone than any other district in the state. This geographic reality, combined with the district's complex topography and strategic position relative to monsoon circulation patterns, creates a perfect confluence of factors that maximizes cloudburst risk.
