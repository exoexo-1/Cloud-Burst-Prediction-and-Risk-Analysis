##  Predictive Indicators

Meteorological precursors that may indicate elevated cloudburst risk in Uttarkashi district include sustained moisture buildup over 48-hour periods with relative humidity exceeding 75%, temperature gradients exceeding 15Â°C between valley floors and peak elevations, and wind convergence patterns within the complex valley systems. Topographic amplification factors in the district can enhance precipitation by 3 to 5 times normal amounts, making even moderate atmospheric disturbances potentially dangerous.

Critical threshold values for the district include rainfall intensities exceeding 80 millimeters per hour, continuous duration exceeding 3 hours, and antecedent soil moisture conditions exceeding 60% saturation. When these conditions coincide, the probability of catastrophic impacts increases dramatically, and emergency preparedness measures should be activated immediately.
