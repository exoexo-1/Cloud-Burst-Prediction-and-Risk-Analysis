## Forest Fire Interaction

Forest fire frequency in Pauri Garhwal district has shown an increasing trend over recent decades, with climate change impacts contributing to drier conditions during critical fire seasons and human activities providing ignition sources. The interaction between forest fires and extreme precipitation events creates complex multi-hazard scenarios that can amplify the impacts of both individual hazards.
Vegetation loss due to forest fires reduces the soil binding capacity of root systems and eliminates the canopy protection that reduces raindrop impact on soil surfaces. These effects can persist for 5 to 7 years after fire events, creating extended periods of elevated vulnerability to erosion and landslides during extreme precipitation events.
Recovery periods for forest ecosystems vary depending on fire intensity, slope conditions, and post-fire weather patterns. In some cases, repeated fire events can prevent full ecosystem recovery and can create permanent changes in vegetation cover and soil stability that increase long-term vulnerability to extreme weather events.
The timing of fire events relative to monsoon seasons creates different risk scenarios. Fires occurring during pre-monsoon periods create maximum vulnerability to erosion and landslides during the subsequent monsoon season, while fires occurring during post-monsoon periods allow some recovery time before the next monsoon season arrives.
