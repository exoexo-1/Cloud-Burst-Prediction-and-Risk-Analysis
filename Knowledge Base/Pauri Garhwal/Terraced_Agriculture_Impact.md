## Terraced Agriculture Impact

Traditional terraced agriculture systems cover approximately 67% of the district's cultivated area, representing one of the most extensive terracing systems in the Himalayas. These terraces, constructed over centuries, have created artificial slope modifications that can influence both the beneficial and adverse effects of extreme precipitation events.
Well-maintained terraces can provide significant benefits for slope stability and erosion control by reducing slope gradients, creating infiltration opportunities, and providing physical barriers to surface runoff. However, abandoned terraces, which now represent approximately 35% of the total terraced area, can actually increase vulnerability to landslides and erosion by creating unsupported cuts in hillslopes and eliminating the vegetation cover that previously provided slope stabilization.
The abandonment of terraces has occurred due to rural-urban migration, changing economic conditions, and the aging of rural populations. This abandonment process typically involves the deterioration of terrace walls, the loss of maintenance activities such as weeding and repair, and the gradual return of terraced areas to natural vegetation. However, the transition period can create unstable conditions where partially maintained terraces are more susceptible to failure than either well-maintained terraces or natural slopes.
Slope modification through terracing creates artificial drainage patterns that can concentrate surface runoff in ways that differ from natural slope conditions. During extreme precipitation events, these modified drainage patterns can create erosion gullies or slope failures that follow the boundaries between terraced and non-terraced areas.
