## Glacial Lake Inventory & GLOF Risk


The glacial lake inventory for Chamoli district reveals 341 identified lakes, representing one of the highest concentrations of glacial lakes in the Himalayas. Of these, 23 have been categorized as dangerous based on criteria including dam stability, water volume, downstream population exposure, and rate of lake expansion. These high-risk lakes pose a constant threat of glacial lake outburst flooding that can occur independently or be triggered by extreme precipitation events such as cloudbursts.

The historical record of glacial lake outburst floods in Chamoli includes the devastating Gohna Lake outburst in 1970, which demonstrated the catastrophic potential of these events. The lake, formed by a landslide dam, eventually breached and sent a flood wave downstream that caused significant damage and casualties. This event established important precedents for understanding the cascading nature of mountain hazards and the potential for secondary effects to exceed the impacts of primary triggers.

The 2021 Chamoli flash flood represents the most recent example of the complex interaction between glacial processes and extreme weather events. While the exact trigger mechanism remains under investigation, the event demonstrated how rapidly glacial hazards can develop and how devastating their downstream impacts can be. The disaster highlighted the need for comprehensive monitoring of glacial lakes and improved understanding of the processes that can trigger sudden releases of stored water and debris.
