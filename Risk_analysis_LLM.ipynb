      "\n",
      "   - **For Authorities:**\n",
      "     - Issue flood warnings to affected areas immediately.\n",
      "     - Ensure emergency services are on standby to respond to calls and evacuations.\n",
      "     - Check and clear drainage systems to facilitate water flow.\n",

      "     - Prepare to close roads near riverbanks that may become flooded.\n",
