      "   - **Soil Moisture**: At 85%, the soil is highly saturated and unable to absorb any more water.\n",
      "   - **Slope**: Steep terrain increases runoff and the speed at which water can flow, raising the flood risk.\n",
      "   - **River Proximity**: 200 m from a water body, which is likely to swell and potentially overflow.\n",
      "   - **Flow Rate**: High flow rates indicate already elevated water levels in nearby streams and rivers.\n",
